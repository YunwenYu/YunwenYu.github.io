        The 10% myth is attractive… <br>

        You've probably heard it: “Humans only use 10% of their brains.” Sounds dramatic, right? Like the other 90% is chilling on a hammock, sipping piña coladas, waiting for us to finally evolve. It's the kind of line that pops up in movies, motivational speeches, and your friend's “deep” late-night chats.

            The origin of the “10% myth” is murky. Some suggest it arose from misinterpretations of early neurological research in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Others believe it came from misquoted statements by psychologists such as William James, who once wrote about people rarely achieving their “full mental potential.” Over time, this vague idea may have morphed into a literal claim that 90% of the brain lies dormant. The media helped spread it, and Hollywood films like Lucy (2014) reinforced the illusion.

            As Scientific American put it, “We use virtually every part of the brain, and most of the brain is active almost all the time.” Translation: your brain is not holding out on you. Even the act of you reading this sentence involves multiple regions firing in sync. If only 10% worked, you wouldn't be reading—you'd be drooling on the couch.

            Clinical observations further refute the myth. If 90% of the brain were redundant, damage to large areas would have minimal behavioral consequences. In reality, even seemingly small brain injuries can result in profound cognitive, sensory, or emotional deficits. This indicates that nearly all regions play critical roles.

            Additionally, evolutionary logic argues against the accumulation of unused brain tissue: such inefficiency would not survive natural selection. The fact that the brain is so metabolically expensive indicates that every part must serve a purpose.
